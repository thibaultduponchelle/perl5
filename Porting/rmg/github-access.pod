=head3 GitHub access

You will need a working C<git> installation, checkout of the perl
git repository and perl commit bit.  For information about working
with perl and git, see L<perlgit>.

If you are not yet a perl committer, you won't be able to make a
release.  You will need to have a GitHub account (if you don't have one)
and contact the Steering Council with your username to get membership in the
L<< Perl-Releasers|https://github.com/orgs/Perl/teams/perl-releasers >> team.
