=head3 Web-based file share

You will need to be able to share tarballs with #p5p members for
pre-release testing, and you may wish to upload to PAUSE via URL.
Make sure you have a way of sharing files, such as a web server or
file-sharing service.

If you use Dropbox, you can append "raw=1" as a parameter to their usual
sharing link to allow direct download (albeit with redirects).
