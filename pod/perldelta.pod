=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.41.6

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.41.5 release and the 5.41.6
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.41.4, first read
L<perl5415delta>, which describes differences between 5.41.4 and 5.41.5.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here. In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report. See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<deprecated>-category
warnings to alert you to this fact. To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use. Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

XXX

=item *

Code that uses the C<indexed> function from the L<builtin> module to generate
a list of index/value pairs out of array which is then passed into a
two-variable C<foreach> list to unpack those again is now optimised to be more
efficient.

    my @array = (...);

    foreach my ($idx, $val) (builtin::indexed @array) {
        ...
    }

In particular, a temporary list twice the size of the original
array is no longer generated.  Instead, the list iterates down the array
in-place directly, in the same way that C<foreach (@array)> would do.

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here. If L<Module::CoreList> is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>. A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand. In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<B::Deparse> has been upgraded from version 1.78 to 1.80.

It now retains parens around logical negations on the left-hand side of
comparisons (such as C<(!$x) == $y>) because omitting them would trigger a
C<Possible precedence problem> warning since perl v5.41.4. [GH #22661]

=item *

L<builtin> has been upgraded from version 0.015 to 0.016.

=item *

L<CPAN> has been upgraded from version 2.37 to 2.38.

=item *

L<IPC::Open3> has been upgraded from version 1.23 to 1.24.
L<IPC::Open2> has been upgraded from version 1.07 to 1.08.

There is now a way to pass lexical filehandles to child processes directly
(instead of having the module create a pipe internally). Previously, only
bareword filehandles could be used in "dup mode".

=item *

L<Math::Complex> has been upgraded from version 1.62 to 1.63.

The complex number parser for string inputs has been improved. In particular,
C<1+i>, C<123i>, C<inf>, C<-inf>, C<infi>, and C<-infi> are now handled
correctly.

=item *

L<Memoize> has been upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.

=item *

L<Module::CoreList> has been upgraded from version 5.20241020 to 5.20241120.

The perl parser would erroneously parse like C<=cut> some other POD directives
whose names start with I<cut>, prematurely terminating an embedded POD section.
The following cases were affected: I<cut> followed by a digit (e.g.
C<=cut2studio>), I<cut> followed by an underscore (e.g. C<=cut_grass>), and in
string C<eval>, any identifier starting with I<cut> (e.g. C<=cute>).

C<cygwin> builds may fail during testing due to a conflict between the
load addresses of F<cygperl5_41_6.dll> and
F<olib/auto/I18N/Langinfo/Langinfo.dll>.  This will also be visible
for anything that attempts to fork() with C<I18N::LangInfo> loaded.

This is known to fail for builds with options that increase the size
of the binary, such as C<-DDEBUGGING>, C<-Doptimize="-O0 -g"> or
C<-Doptimize="-O2 -g -march=x86-64-v2">.

This can be avoided by building perl with
C<-Astatic_ext=I18N/Langinfo>.

The base addresses are generated by the linker based on the names of
the DLLs, so this is expected to clear up for 5.41.7.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.41.6 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.41.5 and contains approximately 8,400 lines of changes across 180 files
from 14 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 6,700 lines of changes to 120 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.41.6:

Chad Granum, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Daniel Dragan, David Mitchell, Graham
Knop, James E Keenan, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai, Marin Tsanov, Paul Evans,
pyrrhlin, Richard Leach, Thibault Duponchelle, Tony Cook.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

see the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. There may also be information at
L<https://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:
