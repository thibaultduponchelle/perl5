=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

C<use 5.36;> or later didn't enable the post parse reporting of L<Name "%s::%s"
used only once: possible typo|perldiag/"Name "%s::%s" used only once: possible
typo"> warnings when enabling warnings.
[L<GH #21271|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21271>]

=item *

Fixed a crash or assertion when cleaning up a closure that refers to an outside
C<our> sub.  [L<GH #21067|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21067>]

=item *

Don't clear the integer flag C<IOK> from lines in the C<< @{"_<$sourcefile"} >>
array when a C<dbstate> op is removed for that line.  This was broken when
fixing [L<GH #19198|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19198>].
[L<GH #21564|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21564>]

=item *

Fixed an issue where `utf8n_to_uvchr` failed to correctly identify certain
invalid UTF-8 sequences as invalid.  Specifically, sequences that start with
continuation bytes or unassigned bytes could cause unexpected behaviour or a
panic.  This fix ensures that such invalid sequences are now properly detected
and handled.  This correction also resolves related issues in modules that
handle UTF-8 processing, such as `Encode.pm`.

=item *

Builds with C<-msse> and quadmath on 32-bit x86 systems would crash with a
misaligned access early in the build.
[L<GH #22577|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22577>]

=item *

Fixed a bug introduced in Perl 5.34 whereby uninitialized data in the
underlying array of an AV after it has been unshifted and resized could lead to
segmentation faults or other errors depending on the data.
[L<GH #21235|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21235>]

=item *

Fixed an issue where Perl sometimes failed to correctly toggle into a dot radix
locale.  [L<GH #21746|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21746>]
[L<GH #22176|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22176>]

=item *

Stopped certain syntax errors from provoking core dumps due to a double free of
an OP.  [L<GH #21724|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21724>]
