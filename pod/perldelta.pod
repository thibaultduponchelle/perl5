=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Starting in v5.39.8, L<POSIX/C<strftime>> would crash or produce odd errors
(such as C<Out of memory in perl:util:safesysmalloc>) when given a format
string that wasn't actually a string, but a number, C<undef>, or an object
(even one with overloaded string conversion).

Now C<strftime> stringifies its first argument, as before. [GH #22498]

=item *

Builds with C<-msse> and quadmath on 32-bit x86 systems would crash
with a misaligned access early in the build. [GH #22577]

=item *

Using C<goto> to tail call, or using the call_sv() and related APIs to
call, any of trim(), refaddr(), reftype(), ceil(), floor() or
stringify() in the C<builtin::> package would crash or assert due to a
C<TARG> handling bug. [GH #22542]

=item *

Fixed an issue where `utf8n_to_uvchr` failed to correctly identify
certain invalid UTF-8 sequences as invalid. Specifically, sequences
that start with continuation bytes or unassigned bytes could cause
unexpected behavior or a panic. This fix ensures that such invalid
sequences are now properly detected and handled. This correction
also resolves related issues in modules that handle UTF-8 processing,
such as `Encode.pm`.

=item *

Fixed a double free error or possible memory leak when failing to compile
certain regexps. [GH #21661]
